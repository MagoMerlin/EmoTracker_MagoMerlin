<h1>The Legend of Zelda Randomizer Readme:</h1>
<br>
-This package is designed to be a item tracker, maybe a map tracker in the future.
<br>
-It's based off of some existing tracker made by MetalMachine in EmoTracker.
<br>
-You can download the program and generate your own <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/zeldarandomizer/">TLOZR ROMHack</a>.
<br>
-TLOZR Tracker REQUIRES <a href="https://emotracker.net/">EmoTracker</a> to work, as it is an additional package to the tracker program.
<br>
This package is made by <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/magomerlin">MagoMerlin</a> and designed to be a extremely simple, both visually and functionally, <br>
though others have helped contribute via suggestions, codes or sprite links. <br>
Thanks to Emosaru and MetalMachine.<br>
