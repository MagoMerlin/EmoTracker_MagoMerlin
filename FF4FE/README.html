<br>
Now with a Map Tracker! Enjoy.
<br>
-This package is designed to be a chars, items, bosses, and locations tracker.
<br>
-It's based off of some existing trackers by <a href="http://schala-kitty.net/ff4fe-tracker/">Schala Kitty</a> and <a href="https://akw5013.gitlab.io/ffiv-free-enterprise-tracker/">Alex Wolff</a>.
<br>
-You can generate your <a href="http://ff4-free-enterprise.com/">FFIVFE ROMHack</a>.
<br>
-FFIVFE Tracker REQUIRES <a href="https://emotracker.net/">EmoTracker</a> to work, as it is an additional package to the tracker program.
<br>
Note: I have not finished the auto tracker yet. It will take a long time, but I will conclude it someday.
<br>
This package is made by <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/magomerlin">MagoMerlin</a> and designed to be a extremely simple, both visually and functionally, <br>
though others have helped contribute via suggestions, codes or sprite links. <br>
Thanks to Emosaru, SchalaKitty, Jaysee87 and Alex Wolff.<br>
