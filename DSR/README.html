<h1>Dark Souls Randomizer Tracker Readme:</h1>
<br>
-This package is designed to be a item tracker, maybe a bosses, covenant and map tracker in the future.
<br>
-It's based off of some existing tracker made by <a href="http://dsrt.orzeu.net/">Eagle</a>.
<br>
-You can download the program and generate your own DSR Seed in <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/1305/">Nexus Mods</a>.
<br>
-DSR Tracker REQUIRES <a href="https://emotracker.net/">EmoTracker</a> to work, as it is an additional package to the tracker program.
<br>
This package is made by <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/magomerlin">MagoMerlin</a> and designed to be a extremely simple, both visually and functionally, <br>
though others have helped contribute via suggestions, codes or sprite links. <br>
Thanks to Emosaru and Eagle.<br>
