Dark Souls Randomizer tracker:

-This package is designed to be a item tracker, maybe a map tracker in the future.

-It's based off of some existing tracker made by Eagle: (http://dsrt.orzeu.net/).

-You can download the program and generate your own DSR Seed: (https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/1305/).

-DSR Tracker REQUIRES EmoTracker to work, as it is an additional package to the tracker program: (https://emotracker.net/).

This package is made by MagoMerlin and designed to be a extremely simple, both visually and functionally, 
though others have helped contribute via suggestions, codes or sprite links. 
Thanks to Emosaru and Eagle.
