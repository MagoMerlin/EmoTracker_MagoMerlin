# MagoMerlin Official Packages
The Legend of Zelda Randomizer tracker for EmoTracker:
-This package is designed to be a TLOZR ROMhack item tracker.
-It's based off of some existing tracker made by MetalMachine in EmoTracker.
-You can download the program and generate your own TLOZR ROMhack: (https://sites.google.com/site/zeldarandomizer/).
Note: I will make a map tracker. It will take a long time.

Final Fantasy IV Free Enterprise tracker for EmoTracker:
-This package is designed to be a FFIVFE item and map tracker.
-It's based off of some existing trackers: (http://schala-kitty.net/ff4fe-tracker/) and (https://akw5013.gitlab.io/ffiv-free-enterprise-tracker/).
-You can generate your FFIVFE ROMHack: (http://ff4-free-enterprise.com/).
Note: I have not finished the map tracker yet. It will take a long time, but I will conclude it someday.

TLOZR Tracker and FFIVFE for Emotracker REQUIRES EmoTracker to work, as they are addon packages to the tracker program: (https://emotracker.net/).

All the packages are made by MagoMerlin and designed to be a extremely simple, both visually and functionally, though others have helped contribute via suggestions, codes or sprite links. Thanks to EmoSaru, SchalaKitty, Jaysee87, Alex Wolff and MetalMachine.
